VedAI is an AI-powered teaching assistant that revolutionizes the online learning experience by leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques. Powered by the fine-tuned LLaMA 3 model, one of the best open-source language models on the planet, VedAI offers a comprehensive platform that transforms the way students and educators interact with digital content.

## Key Features

- **Lecture Note Generation**: VedAI converts audio recordings of lectures into detailed, structured notes. It transcribes the audio using speech-to-text technology and analyzes the transcription to identify key topics and discussions based on the lesson plan. The generated notes include summaries of the discussed topics with associated timestamps, making it easy to navigate and review specific sections of the lecture.

- **Quiz Generation**: By analyzing the lecture content, VedAI can generate multiple-choice quizzes that cover the key concepts discussed during the lecture. These quizzes serve as a valuable tool for students to assess their comprehension and reinforce their understanding of the material.

- **Extensive File Integration**: VedAI supports the integration of over 30 different file formats, allowing users to extract valuable insights and information from a wide range of sources. Whether you're working with PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, code files, or even images, VedAI can process and analyze the content seamlessly.
